This is my submission for project 5. 

To run this project just open the index.html file.

You should then see a map of Phoenix, AZ with 10 markers placed at locations around the city. 

If you click on either a marker or a list item then an info bubble should appear telling you a little info as well as an asynchronous call to foursquare.com to get the star rating and full name of the venue. 

You can search by entering terms in the search box and clicking "search". The markers have a few tags added e.g. food, coffee, etc. In addition the search should look through the title and info bubble text. There is no boolean logic implemented with this search. 

If the screen is too small then the list view is hidden using a media query and some css.
